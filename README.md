Energe
======

My first website. Created for Business Professional's of America's Web Site Design Team Competition 2014.
The site is supposed to allow users to see alternative energy sources available in any city in the United States. There wasn't any substantial research conducted, I stored random text in the proper data heirarchy in the locations.json file so that the information could easily be added later.
